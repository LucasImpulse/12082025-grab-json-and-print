# task says: 1. access https://my-json-server.typicode.com/marcuzh/router_location_test_api/db
# i see a JSON format if i access using Chrome.


# 2. read data from API
# could just use a standard library here

# 3. output list of connections between locations

# so print iterate over a list
# list has "connections" which describe a relationship between two nodes ("locations")
# could just make a Connection class to cover that, which returns both location names
# and allows handling duplicates easier.
